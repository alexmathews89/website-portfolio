              Node.js was used in this project to create an API for the myFlix
              app. This app allows a user to create an account, view a list of
              movies as well as their genre and director, update their user
              information, add and remove movies from their list of favorites
              and delete their account. A few other technologies and packages
              used were Express, Morgan, and MongoDB. The code for this API can

              The Meet app is a progressive web application that uses serverless
              programming and allows users to authenticate themselves using
              OAuth and their gmail address. With this app, a user can veiw
              details about multiple programming events taking place in various
              cities and countries. This app takes on a test driven development
              approach and uses the Google Calendar as an API and also
              implements Recharts. A few other frameworks and technologies used
              in this app are Puppeteer, jest, Atatus and this project also uses
              a little bit of object oriented programming to create certain app
              alerts. The app can be veiwed

              The Chat App is a project developed with React Native. With this
              application a user can enter their name and choose a color for
              their chat screen before entering a chat room where they can also
              take and send a photo, choose a photo from their library to send
              as well as send their location. The Chat App was developed for a
              mobile device, so it isn't hosted on the web but the app can be
              ran by simply creating an Expo account and then downloading and
              installing Expo Go on your device(smartphone) and/or a virtual
              Android emulator and then downloading the GitHub project folder
              <a href="https://github.com/alexmathews89/chat" target="_blank"
                >here</a
              >. From there, navigate to the project folder using the terminal
              and run the command "npm start" or "expo start." You can then open
              Expo Go on your device and select the chat app to create a
              username and enter the chat room. The technologies being used in
              this project are React Native, Firestore, Expo, GiftedChat,
              AsyncStorage, StackNavigator, expo-location, expo-image-picker and
              react-native-maps.

              The myFlix UI above is very similar to the myFlix project
              developed with React. The only difference is that this project was
              developed using Angular. Just like the React project, this
              application allows a user to create an account, log in, view a
              movie's genre and director, view a description of the genre, add
              and remove movies to and from their list of favorites, update
              their profile information and log out. The application can be
